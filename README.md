# Parallelized and Distributed HNSW based Prediction Algorithm
This repo contains the implementation of Parallelized and Distributed HNSW based prediction algorithm using OpenMP and OpenMPI. 

Solution to Assignment 3 of the course COL380- Introduction to Parallel and Distributed Programming offered in Second (Holi) Semester 2021-22.

## HNSW
HNSW stands for Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs. HNSW is designed to reduce the prediction complexity of One-vs-All (OVA) method from O(L) to O(logL). This reduction in complexity is achieved by learning a hierarchical graph structure.
